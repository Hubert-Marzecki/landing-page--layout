## Empressia landing page
Landing Page created during the recruitment process. Used fonts are slightly different from those in design because of the lack of polish signs in free options available online. With a good font, an update can be made in a maximum of 2-3 clicks in /variable.scss. The page is fully responsive, use localStorage, few libraries, and best practices in React development.
